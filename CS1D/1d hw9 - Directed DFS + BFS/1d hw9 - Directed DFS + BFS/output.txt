Program: Assignment 9 - Directed DFS and BFS
===================================================
Programmer: Aaron Geesink and Faris Hijazi
Class: CS 1D - 5:00 PM M W
===================================================
In this program, we will construct directed graphs of 12 cities. Part A performs a
DFS on a directed graph using an adjacency list starting from Chicago,
and part B performs a BFS on a directed graph using an adjacency matrix.
Discovery, back, forward, and cross edges are labeled for each traversal,
and the sum of the discovery edges is added up and displayed.
Part C checks to see if the graph is strongly connected.

The graph is strongly connected, as all nodes can
be accessed no matter which node the traversal starts on.
