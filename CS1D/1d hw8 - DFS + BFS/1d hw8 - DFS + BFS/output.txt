===================================================
Program: DFS and BFS (Assignment 8)
===================================================
Programmer: Aaron Geesink and Garrett Geesink
Class: CS 1D - 5:00 PM M W
===================================================
In this program, we will construct a graph of 12 cities. Part A performs a
DFS on a graph using an adjacency list starting from Chicago,
and part B performs a BFS on a graph using an adjacency matrix.
the total amount travelled along discovery edges, back edges, or cross edges
is added up and displayed as well.
===================================================

=================== Part A =====================
DFS Starting From Chicago

Here is the adjacency list and the order the cities are visited:
Chicago -> Seattle -> New York -> Boston -> Denver -> Kansas City
Seattle -> Chicago -> San Francisco -> Denver
San Francisco -> Seattle -> Los Angeles -> Denver
Los Angeles -> San Francisco -> Denver -> Kansas City -> Dallas
Denver -> Los Angeles -> Kansas City -> Seattle -> San Francisco -> Chicago
Kansas City -> Denver -> New York -> Los Angeles -> Dallas -> Atlanta -> Chicago
New York -> Kansas City -> Boston -> Chicago -> Atlanta
Boston -> New York -> Chicago
Atlanta -> Miami -> Dallas -> Houston -> Kansas City -> New York
Miami -> Atlanta -> Houston
Houston -> Miami -> Dallas -> Atlanta
Dallas -> Houston -> Los Angeles -> Kansas City -> Atlanta

Discovery edge distance: 9348
Back edge distance: 33254

=================== Part B ===================
Here is the order of the Breadth First Traversal, starting from Chicago.
Chicago
Seattle
Denver
Kansas City
New York
Boston
San Francisco
Los Angeles
Dallas
Atlanta
Houston
Miami

Total distance traveled over discovery edges: 11175
Total distance traveled over cross edges: 31427

Here is the adjacency matrix:
